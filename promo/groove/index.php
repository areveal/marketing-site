			<h2>A world of customer insight with just one question</h2>
			<blockquote><em>“How likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?”</em></blockquote>
			<p>The Net Promoter Score categorizes your customers into three categories: Promoters, Passives, and Detractors.<br> 
			Your NPS score is calculated by taking the percentage of customers who are Promoters<br>
			and subtracts the percentage who are Detractors: NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors</p>
